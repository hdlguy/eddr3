ddr3 subproject for Elphel 393 camera

This subproject is started to create a DDR3 memory controller for Elphel camera that does not depend on any non-documented
features of Xilinx Zynq and can be simulated by Free Software tools (Icarus Verilog + GTKWave) without use of any encrypted
modules. Everything in plain Verilog and constraints.

Detailed description of the project is available in the blog post: http://blog.elphel.com/2014/06/ddr3-memory-interface-on-xilinx-zynq-soc-free-software-compatible/

This fork of eddr3 is created to be modified to run on VC707 eval board using the 1GB SODIMM.
